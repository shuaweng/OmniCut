/**
* Abstract background job registry. Subclass, implement the abstract members,
* and load the subclass as a plugin — it registers as `ctx.jobs` (one
* implementation per context; loading a second throws, which is cordis'
* standard duplicate-service behavior).
*
* Implementations must honor these semantics:
* - Registrations outlive producer and controller fibers. Owner and
*   service disposal cancel live work and await compliant producers; a
*   throwing teardown cancel force-fails only the record. Such settlements
*   announce `cause: 'teardown'`, because a job whose owner is being destroyed
*   has no reader left.
* - Owned-job access is fenced by the owner's session id. Ids are
*   predictable, so authorization — not secrecy — is the boundary.
* - Settlement is first-wins: one terminal record, released waiters, then one
*   round of contained event delivery, even against a late producer outcome.
*   The `settled` event follows every released waiter and reports whether it
*   released one (`awaited`), so a completion reporter can skip settlements a
*   waiting caller already collected.
* - A settled record stays listed until its owner's disposal, service
*   disposal, or an explicit {@link remove} by a caller that collected the
*   terminal state itself and never handed the id out.
* - {@link start} refuses work while no attached job controller serves the
*   spec's owner, so a producer cannot start work that owner cannot collect
*   or stop. One registry serves every composition in the process, so this
*   question — and event delivery under `{ owners: 'scope' }` — is
*   owner-relative rather than process-wide: registrations made from an
*   unscoped context serve every owner, and registrations made under an agent
*   composition's scope serve exactly the agents composed under it.
* - Every job owns one output ring. Pull sources named by the spec are pumped
*   by the registry and drained once more before settlement; pushed appends
*   land whole. The model's consuming cursor and observers' absolute offsets
*   read the same bytes and never disturb each other.
* - Ring retention is bounded. Appends past the live cap drop the oldest
*   retained bytes; a reader below the retained window gets a lossy read,
*   never an error. Settlement trims retention to the settled cap and ends
*   the stream; the ring has no separate lifecycle.
