/**
 * The store shell over the docking kit: one surface per session, held as plain
 * data so the kit's pure functions are the only thing that ever computes a
 * layout.
 *
 * Every action follows the same steps — mint the ids the intent needs, ask the
 * kit's planner what operations carry it out, let the settle planner keep every
 * pane populated, record it all as one history entry — and then assigns the
 * session's whole surface back in one go. Nothing here reaches into a draft to
 * edit a layout in place, which is what keeps the kit testable without a store
 * and keeps snapshot identity honest.
 *
 * The settle step is this product's rule, not the kit's: an intent never leaves
 * an expanded column with an empty pane — emptied side panes merge away, and an
 * empty root pane seeds the default page. A collapsed column may stand empty;
 * the seed waits for the expansion that would otherwise show nothing.
 *
 * A focus that changes nothing — a tab already active in its already-active
 * pane, a pane already active — plans nothing and records nothing, whoever
 * asks: the kit's chip click and `ctx.sidebarRight.focus` alike.
 *
 * So is page uniqueness: a pane holds at most one tab of each page kind (a tab
 * whose content is the kind's own page address — the guide, the explorer).
 * Opening a page into a pane that shows it focuses that tab, in that pane and
 * nowhere else, and a page dragged, dropped, or docked into such a pane merges
 * into the pane's own — the arriving tab closes and the pane's own is focused.
 * The kit plans none of this; it is decided here before its planners run.
