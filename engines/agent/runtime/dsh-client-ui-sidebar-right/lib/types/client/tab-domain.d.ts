/**
 * The Tab domain: what a tab record carries that the layout does not.
 *
 * One `TabOccurrence` per open record, keyed by (session, tab id): where the
 * tab was navigated to, an abort signal spanning the record's life, and the
 * actions the tab may take on itself. Holding a record also pins its address in
 * the resource model, so switching tabs unmounts a body without dropping its
 * content.
 *
 * `sync` reconciles occurrences against one session's layout after every
 * commit: a record that appeared is pinned, one that vanished (closed, or its
 * open undone) is aborted and dropped. A record restored by undo is a new
 * occurrence and is fetched again if the resource model already let it go. The
 * controller syncs each session from that session's adopted store on every
 * commit, on screen or not, so a record closed from another session's seat is
 * aborted on that commit. The slot framework binds the navigation sources for
 * each record's `useTabInfo` reader.
