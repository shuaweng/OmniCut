/**
 * CommandUiRuntime (`ctx.commandUi`): the '/' command source over the
 * session-keyed directory, the client-contribution registry, and the
 * per-session popupSelect controllers. Candidate synthesis merges the host
 * catalog with contributions by availability, gives built-in Host rows their
 * localized face (presentation.ts), then position-filters; an empty query
 * lists the Add and Commands sections in usage order, a typed query ranks
 * every row by the `/` menu's shared name-and-label ranking (ui-primitives
 * `rankByName`). A host/contribution name collision fails loud. Every
 * execute addresses the session's agent by sessionId — sessions are always
 * agent-backed.
 * Catalog RPCs retain an existing Client Session through completion and
 * wait for its initial history open to succeed before contacting the Host.
