/**
 * The agent-preset chip on the new-session screen, beside the workspace
 * picker.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the composer because the choice is only
 * available before a conversation starts: once a turn has run, the session's
 * history was produced under that preset's tools and the host refuses to swap
 * them. A control that spends most of its life disabled belongs on the screen
 * where it still works.
 *
 * The menu opens on the staged choice, which starts as the deployment default.
 * Picking stages; the choice reaches a session when one becomes current.
