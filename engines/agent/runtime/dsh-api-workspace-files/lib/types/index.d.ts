/**
 * Workspace file service: read-only file previews, workspace directory
 * listings, and the filesystem-observation change feed, exposed as
 * `workspaceFiles`.
 *
 * File reads follow the composed filesystem's read access, including paths
 * outside the workspace. The selected Session header supplies the base for
 * relative paths, with the sandbox policy root as its no-cwd fallback, not a
 * read-containment restriction. Directory listings and change observations
 * remain workspace-scoped. File-kind checks and configured read caps apply to
 * every preview; this service exposes no mutations.
 *
 * A page is cut from `streamText`, which decodes and rejects non-UTF-8 as it
 * goes, so the file is read only up to the first character past the page and
 * never held whole in memory; the NUL scan runs on the page itself.
 *
 * This is NOT modelled on `session.openWorkspacePath`. That endpoint hands a
 * path to the local opener and leaves the effect on the machine; this one sends
 * file content across the wire, which is a different level of exposure.
