/**
 * The `file` protocol's provider: a workspace file's metadata as a stream of
 * `RemoteResult` frames.
 *
 * An address names the file in one of two scopes. A `session` address,
 * `dsh-resource://file/session/<sessionId>/<path>`, carries an absolute path or one
 * relative to that Session's workspace root: the Host receives the path as-is and
 * resolves it against the root it holds. Only the Host's `stat.absolutePath`
 * selects the change-feed key; no Client Session summary is needed.
 * An `absolute` address, `dsh-resource://file/absolute/<path>`, carries no
 * Session and cannot authorize a Host call. An address neither scope
 * resolves yields one failure frame — `workspace-file/unsupported-address` for
 * a string outside the grammar, `workspace-file/unknown-workspace` when the
 * address carries no Session — and ends.
 *
 * The first frame is the file's `stat`; subsequent invalidations run `stat`
 * again unless their version or absence is already known. Reconnection also
 * restats the file. Failures travel as `ok: false` frames, never as thrown errors: the
 * Remote face does not reject, and anything thrown inside the stream is a
 * programming error the resource model lets surface. A failed stat does not end
 * the stream: the next write stats again. One {@link ChangeFeed}
 * serves every open file of the Client.
