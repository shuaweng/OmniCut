 * Generic per-session projection value store (push model; see the

 * the host is the only computation site; the client holds finished whole
 * values per key in one of two row kinds. A `sequenced` row
 * (`{ value, seq }`) comes from the connected Host — a follow opening
 * baseline, a Session Controller `projection` frame, a list block the Host
 * computed for an attached Session — and merges under **higher seq wins**
 * against other sequenced rows. A `cached` row (`{ value }`) comes from the
 * session list's view of the persisted checkpoint, carries no comparable
 * seq, and yields to every sequenced write. No client-side domain folding
 * exists: a domain ships projection support with zero client code. Per-key
 * bare observable faces feed `useProjection` (ui-renderer binds them).
