/**
 * The preview's own state: the pages it has read, and how the reader views them.
 *
 * The `file` resource carries metadata only, so the text is this type's to fetch
 * and keep — page by page, keyed by the 1-based line each page starts at. The
 * view state (scroll offset, wrap, the navigation already answered) must outlive
 * the body: a tab switched away from unmounts its body and must come back where
 * it was rather than re-read or jump to its opening line again. Bucketed by tab
 * id because two tabs of one file scroll independently.
 *
 * A bucket lives as long as its tab record: the face's first read of a tab arms
 * one listener on the owner's `signal` that forgets the bucket when the record
 * ends, and a tab that never read has no bucket to forget.
