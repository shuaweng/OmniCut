/**
 * Goal surface plugin, browser half: the GoalBar entry in the
 * conversation.input.dock strip. The durable goal arrives through
 * `useProjection('goal')`. A registrant-private activation hook source owns
 * the live Remote read and event subscription; the inject face carries that
 * hook plus the four mutation verbs through the generated Goal Remote API.
 * Activation reads retain the Client Session through completion and wait
 * for its initial history open to succeed before contacting the Host.
 * This plugin does not create goals; deployments may expose /goal separately.
