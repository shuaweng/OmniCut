 * Capture coordinator for the telemetry capability. Live capture subscribes to
 * the session firehose plus the one live-bus relay (`agent/error`). Both
 * capture paths build one logical record per canonical Session event and run
 * each through the
 * `session-telemetry/record` waterfall (deployment-mounted redaction rules;
 * pass-through when none), then hands the result to the backend. Live capture
 * follows the session firehose; on-demand capture replays the canonical log
 * only when requested. Every synchronous handler is self-contained so a
 * failing backend can never starve other subscribers (cordis `emit` is
 * stop-on-throw) or touch the agent loop. Composed by a backend in its
 * constructor.
